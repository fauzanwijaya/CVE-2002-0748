# Synopsis
The remote web server is prone to a denial of service attack.

# Description
It was possible to kill the web server by sending a request that ends with two LF characters instead of the normal sequence CR LF CR LF (CR = carriage return, LF = line feed).

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make this server and all LabView applications crash.

# Solution
Upgrade your LabView software or run the web server with logging disabled.
